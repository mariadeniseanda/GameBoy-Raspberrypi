# GameBoy-Raspberrypi
I am currently working a RaspberryPi project to make a modern 'GameBoy' type handheld. It will run themed/modified version the the RaspberryPi OS and will be fully navigate able through the use of buttons and joy cons. This repository will contain all of the software side this project :)
